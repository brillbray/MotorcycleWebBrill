                   <strong>Aprilia</strong> is an Italian motorcycle manufacturer founded immediately after World War
                    II in Noale, Italy, by Alberto Beggio.
                    The company started as a manufacturer of bicycles and moved on to manufacture scooters and small-capacity motorcycles.                       
                    Aprilia has supported a strong motorsport competition program beginning with motocross racing and then a world championship-winning road racing program. The company was acquired by Piaggio in 2004.

                    <br>
                    Aprilia entered the Superbike World Championship in 1999 using a homologation special
                    version of their V-twin road bike RSV Mille. They were third in the riders' championship 
                    in 2000 with rider Troy Corser, and third in manufacturers' points and fourth in rider points
                    both in 2001 with Corser and in 2002 with Noriyuki Haga. Aprilia retired from the series at the 
                    end of that season.

                <p id="brandYamahaDesc">The motorcycle division of <strong>Yamaha</strong>  was founded in 1955, being incorporated on 1 July 1955 in Japan, and was headed by Genichi Kawakami.
                    Yamaha's initial product was a 125 cc (7.6 cu in) two-cycle, 
                    single cylinder motorcycle, the YA-1, which was a copy of the German DKW RT 125. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                  
                    The YA-1 was a competitive success at racing from the beginning, winning not only the 125cc class in the Mt. Fuji Ascent,
                    but also sweeping the podium with first, second and third place in the All Japan Autobike Endurance Road Race that same year.

                    Early success in racing set the tone for Yamaha, as competition in many varieties of motorcycle racing has been a key endeavor of the company throughout its history, often fueled by a strong rivalry with Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and other Japanese manufacturers.</p>

                    <strong>Ducatic</strong> is a group of companies, best known for manufacturing motorcycles and headquartered 
                    in Borgo Panigale, Bologna, Italy. The group is owned by German automotive manufacturer Audi 
                    through its Italian subsidiary Lamborghini, which is in turn owned by the Volkswagen Group.
                    In the 1930s and 1940s, Ducati manufactured radios, cameras, and electrical products such as razors.

                    <br>
                    Ducati also made a marine binocular called the BIMAR for the Kriegsmarine during World War II, some of which were sold on the civilian market after the war. 
                    The Ducati Sogno was a half-frame Leica-like camera which is now a collector's item. Ducati and Bianchi have developed and launched a new line of racing bicycles.

                   <strong>Honda</strong>  has been the world's largest motorcycle manufacturer since 1959, reaching a production of 400 million by the end of 2019,
                     as well as the world's largest manufacturer of internal combustion engines measured by volume, producing more than 14 million

                     <br><br>
                     Honda was the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to release a dedicated luxury 
                     brand, Acura, in 1986. Aside from their core automobile and motorcycle businesses, 
                     Honda also manufactures garden equipment, marine engines, personal watercraft,
                     power generators, and other products. 
                     <br><br>
                     In 2013, Honda invested about 5.7% (US$6.8 billion) of its revenues into research 
                     and development. Also in 2013, Honda became the first Japanese automaker to be a net
